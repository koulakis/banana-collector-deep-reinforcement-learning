# Banana collector

## Introduction
This is a solution for the first project of the [Udacity deep reinforcement learning course](https://www.udacity.com/course/deep-reinforcement-learning-nanodegree--nd893). It includes code for training an agent and for using it in a simulation environment.

## Problem description
The agent is placed in a room with bananas and its goal is to collect as many fresh (yellow) bananas as possible during a fixed amount of time while avoiding rotten bananas (blue).

- Rewards:
  - +1 for each yellow banana collected
  - -1 for each blue banana collected
- Input state:
  - 37 dimesions with the agent's velocity and ray-based perception of the environment
- Actions:
  - 0: forward
  - 1: backward
  - 2: left
  - 3: right
- Goal:
  - Get an average score of at least 13 over 100 consecutive episodes
